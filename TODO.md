## TODO
- read up on  [gff files](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes_gff/#basicformat)
- find unique values in "gbkeys" section (done)
- fine unique values in that big 2nd col.  (done)
- look at which chromosomes have rRNA (like sections )
- NC vs NW in the first column of each line 
- when ever you filter for something try to validate with the opposite 
- think about overlap regions ie regions where we pull rRNA but there are other reads in that region
- look into 'gbkey=GENE, gen_biotype=rRNA'
- look for cds  in gb_key
