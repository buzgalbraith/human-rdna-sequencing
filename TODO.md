## TODO
  - check on existing plots (probably remove the edit distance)
  - add the region of the gene we are looking at to the coverage plot (use snap gene viewer)
    - try to just read .gb file as a text file, the RNA sections are written as 'rRNA            7935..12969'
  - keep track of time it takes to run each step in our bash file.
  - fix bug in data generation code.
